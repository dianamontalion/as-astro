### Understanding Systems Thinking and the Role of an Architect

In this insightful discussion, Diana and Kris delves into the evolving and often misunderstood role of an architect in the tech world. Drawing from systems thinking, they explain:

- **Defining an Architect**: The role of an architect is fluid, context-dependent, and tailored to the unique challenges of different systems. There is no "one architect to rule them all."
- **The Real Problem with Silos**: Teams in organizations are often disconnected, and attempts to bridge silos (like holding meetings) rarely solve systemic issues.
- **Architecture as Relationships**: Architecture is about understanding **how relationships produce effects** within a system, identifying patterns, and addressing root causes instead of symptoms.
- **Avoiding Glue Work**: Architects shouldn't just "patch" teams together. Instead, they should focus on redesigning communication and workflows to enable effective collaboration.

Diana emphasizes how **knowledge flow** is critical to organizational success. They discuss how architects must synthesize inputs from leaders, teams, and technology to align the system with its goals, highlighting the importance of:

- Addressing counterintuitive patterns in complex systems.
- Focusing on shared purpose and systemic capabilities over isolated features.
- Iterative approaches to architecture rather than top-down, linear plans.

Kris constructs a thought-provoking take on how we can rethink the architect's role and use systems thinking to design better, more resilient organizations.
