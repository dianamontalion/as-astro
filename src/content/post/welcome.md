Architecting Systems (AS) is an independent publication launched by [Diana Montalion](https://montalion.com). Diana is systems architect, writer, speaker and knowledge flow deviser. She is also part of a growing community of systems thinkers who are working together to create better information and knowledge systems. You'll meet them too!

*From Software to Systems* and *Learning Systems Thinking* ... are now combined and relaunched as ***Architecting Systems***. You won't be getting (just) a newsletter, you'll have access to a digital ecosystem of systems thinking tools and practices.

**Each week or so, you’ll receive a short but oh-so-sweet newsletter**, including a collated list of resources published by experts:

- Talks, books, podcasts, and other learning experiences.
- Upcoming events that encourage systems thinking. (When possible, you’ll also get discounts to those events.)
- Courses, hot topics of discussion and an inspiring quote or two.

You also join a growing community of professionals who are figuring out how to design and deliver knowledge systems. In the modern world, it's not enough to build data pipelines and information-sharing software –  we need to think in systems. As relational complexity increases, we are discovering and developing different skills and approaches.
