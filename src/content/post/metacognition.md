Every morning, I wake up before dawn and head downstairs to the kitchen. My cat pads along behind me. I grind [coffee beans](https://www.drinktrade.com/) and press them into a half-caff double shot of espresso. I stir in frothed-up [Silk Original Creamer](https://silk.com/plant-based-products/creamer/original-soy-creamer/), then carry my mug up to my study.

The cat and I settle into the lounge chair by the window and I click open a [Pilot Vanishing Point fountain pen](https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-vanishing-point-fountain-pens/products/pilot-vanishing-point-fountain-pen-blue-matte#) (the same one Neil Gaiman uses). As I open my [Firma-Flex notebook](http://penhabit.com/2015/02/18/paper-review-franklin-christoph-firma-flex-journals/), I say “Alexa, Good Morning.”

“Good morning, Diana. Today is Thursday, November 3rd. The time is 5:15am. The weather today is 52 degrees with some sun. [pause] One hour … starting now.”

I begin writing. I don’t have an agenda, I just show up and keep my hand moving. My journal creates a feedback loop – I think and engage my thinking; investigate, question, explore. Insights arise that I would never otherwise grok. This daily practice reveals patterns in my thinking that aren’t always pretty or wholly rational, my thoughts can be repetitive, resentful and “stuck in the mud”.

If I were forced to recommend only one practice for improving thinking, I'd pick this one. But 5:00am journaling doesn’t work for everyone. At different stages of my life, different self awareness practices have worked — meditation, yoga, therapy and long hikes in the wilderness for example. [Gandhi spun thread.](https://www.mkgandhi.org/gandhiji/09spinning_wheel.htm) When cultivating self awareness, what matters is *practice*, not the framework you use to implement it.

Why does this subject matter to people who build technology? **You can not improve your thinking if you aren't aware of your thinking**. What we think is what we build. Everything in production mirrors our thinking, at one point in time. **If we want to change what we deploy, we first need to change how we think.**

**Changing what we think begins with practicing metacognition and self awareness.**

Metacognition is *“awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes*.” Thinking is an activity you can observe. Our thoughts are far less under our control than we might imagine. Changing our thought patterns is not about willpower, it is about insight: the capacity to gain an accurate and intuitive understanding of our experiences.

Self awareness is observing our most intimate system - ourselves. **Thinking is a whole body experience** involving emotions, sensations, our past wounds, future plans, cultural conditioning and physical health. Our thoughts trigger actions and actions trigger more thoughts. Different actions arise from different thoughts (and vice versa).

Strong self awareness enables us to objectively interpret thoughts, feelings, experiences. As a result, we make better choices and take more effective actions. Strengthening objective interpretation is a foundation on which we build better decision making, together.

There is nearly-endless, often-fascinating mind science to explore here. I encourage you to go easy on the theory. Look at and understand *your* mind, patterns and processes. It’s easy to get swept up in the interesting ideas. It’s difficult to become aware of what you think, feel and experience.
