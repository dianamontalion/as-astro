## **Learning Systems Thinking**

As the relational complexity of our software systems increases, our traditional, linear thinking approaches are insufficient. Software professionals, especially those building modern interdependent, event-driven software and services need to think in systems.

Systems thinking is becoming a core and critical skill.

In this workshop, you'll learn, how systems thinking practices can help you make impactful changes -- despite the emerging complexity of modern systems. Systems thinking transforms how we learn, communicate, and collaborate with others. Which will, in turn, transform what we push to production.

Through hands-on exercises and real-world scenarios, you'll develop critical self-reflection and decision-making skills, use systems-thinking models and tools, and craft sound recommendations amid complexity and uncertainty.

### **For who?**

Software professionals working in "modern" systems where relational complexity is increasing, and cross-functional collaboration is necessary. Regardless of your role, these skills will help you lead impactful change within your organization.

### **Learning Objectives**

- How linear thinking limits your perspective on software systems.
- The obstacles to changing your perspective and how to move past them.
- How systems and nonlinear thinking help you understand and navigate complex issues arising from internal and external factors.
- Methods for creating sound, cross-functional recommendations in the midst of complexity and uncertainty.
- Using the Iceberg Model and leverage points to guide systemic change.
- How nonlinear approaches improve the quality of architectural thinking and deliver impactful change for organizations.
- How writing, thinking and modeling are core architecture practices
- How to provide a modern style of leadership as software becomes information systems. We will work together on a systems challenge where there is no "right" answer, only the answers we can craft using systems thinking practices.
