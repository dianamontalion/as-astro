Architecting Systems (AS) is an independent publication launched by [Diana Montalion](https://montalion.com). Diana is systems architect, writer, speaker and knowledge flow deviser. She is also part of a growing and thriving community of systems thinkers who are working together to create better information and knowledge systems.

AS integrates the previous newsletter, *From Software to Systems*, with resources from the [Systems Library](https://systemslibrary.com/) and new content expanding on Diana's book: [*Learning Systems Thinking: Essential Non-linear Skills and Practices for Software Professionals*](https://learningsystemsthinking.com). 

**As a free subscriber, each week or so, you’ll receive a short but oh-so-sweet newsletter** – a collated list of resources published by experts:

- Talks, books, podcasts, and other learning experiences. Published by systems experts in diverse fields.
- Upcoming events that encourage systems thinking. (When possible, you’ll also get discounts to those events.)
- Courses, hot topics of discussion and an inspiring quote or two.

(You can also subscribe via RSS.)
