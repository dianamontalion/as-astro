title: 'The Friction Fix: Building Collaborative Relationships Between Teams  -- QCon London'
excerpt: 'In the tech industry, we are most interested in knowledge stock: What do you know? This focus is holding many individuals, teams and organizations back. As relational complexity increases, individual knowledge stock is insufficient. What we need is knowledge flow.'

In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, the friction between product and technology teams often feels inevitable. Misaligned mindsets, priorities, and contextual biases create obstacles that slow progress, stifle innovation, breed frustration, and encourage blame.

Instead of fostering collaboration, we resort to tighter controls and increased separation, widening the gap even further. However, effective collaboration is crucial for delivering impactful results and driving success.

Diana Montalion (systems architect) and Cat Morris (product manager) will examine the distinct yet interconnected concerns of product and architecture, unraveling why friction arises and how it can be mitigated. Drawing from 30+ years of combined real-world experience, they will show how the flow of data and information—when presented in the right way and context—can bridge gaps and generate shared knowledge.

Attendees will gain practical strategies for designing systems and processes that enable knowledge flow. Empowering teams to make informed decisions and deliver impactful outcomes. Together.
