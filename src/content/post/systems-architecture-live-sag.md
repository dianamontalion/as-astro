Welcome to MAGO! 

MAGO is the most-read magazine and digital product producer in the world. Today is your first day as an architect. Welcome architect! You were hired just in time -- a crisis is looming. You and your teammates will create a recommendation … what will MAGO do next? You’ll see some models. You’ll seek advice about how the system works. You’ll enjoy the egalitarian experience of “doing architecture” as a collective, cross-functional practice. And you'll learn some fundamental systems-thining skills for software professionals.

In daily life, we are surrounded by increasing relational complexity. Our need for relationally-smart, systems-thinking practices is increasing along with it. When done well, these practice delivers domain-aligned, team-decoupling, cohesiveness-driving, constantly-evolving impactful recommendations. We’ll have some fun strengthening our real-world skills:

- Build an architectural recommendation, as a group- Give and receive architectural advice
- Practice systemic reasoning and knowledge flow
- Pivot and adapt as systemic constraints are revealed
- Create a new mental model that will lead to the desirable outcome
- Create signal in the midst of noise
- Have wicked fun doing it

Together, we will learn from each other about communication, decision making and the fine art of improvisational systems design.Regardless of your role, you can apply these skills to improve your impact on the systems around you. If you've ever wanted to join an architectural kata, this workshop will give you a big advantage!
