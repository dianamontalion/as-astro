In this engaging conversation with Diana Montalion - former principal systems architect at The Economist and Wikimedia Foundation, and author of "Learning Systems Thinking" - we explore why traditional software development approaches are struggling to keep up with modern system complexity.

Diana shares insights from her extensive experience building large-scale information systems, explaining how relationships between components often matter more than the components themselves. She discusses the critical shift from reductionist thinking to systems thinking, illustrated through practical examples from distributed systems and event-driven architectures.

Diana and Dave explore what it really means to think systematically about complex software systems. They discuss why the future of software development requires us to move beyond simplistic solutions toward a more nuanced understanding of system dynamics.
