### Hands-on Training

Systems thinking expands your capacity to do difficult things. For software developers, relational complexity is increasingly difficult. Cross-functional thinking is difficult to orchestrate. Changing entrenched organizational patterns is difficult. Thinking in systems … is difficult.

Peter Senge has demonstrated that we blame the wrong things (events, situations or processes) for our systemic problems. W. Edwards Deming says that 94% of the time, the system is to blame for performance issues, not the individual parts of the system. Jay Forrester discovered counterintuitiveness: most organizations “fix” systemic problems by inadvertently making them worse.

In this workshop, you’ll learn why systems thinking is difficult to master. What are the blockers and challenges?

You’ll learn a few core practices that will expand your skillset. We’ll use the Iceberg Model to explore the root cause of recurring systems problems. You can use these practices to help you develop impactful recommendations.
