In my lifetime, we have experienced the equivalent of 20,000 years of change. Nonlinear change. In many respects, we are the architects of change, yet we seem to do the same things again and again, expecting different results. 

Digital information systems have had a staggering effect on relational complexity. Yet, we still approach software development in a mechanistic, industrial and reductionistic way of our thinking.
